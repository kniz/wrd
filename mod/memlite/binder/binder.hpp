    ///         this has 3 features.
    ///             1) can distringuish what given abstract type actually was and reject or accept it
    ///                regarding that.
    ///             2) free instance completely. using RAII.
    ///             3) can notice that binding instance was replaced or freed without unexpected exception.
    ///         in conlusion, it prevent halting process or give a chance to let developer be advised.
    ///
    ///     type cheking:
    ///         this was most valuable requirement when I design component of bind.
    ///         in fact, bind was suggested to replace sort of exisiting smart-ptr concept things,
    ///         such as weakptr. because weakptr was planned to replace and enhance existing pointer
    ///         of c/c++, they were very strict to check type and whether template param T was const
    ///         or not. this characteristic was pretty worked good in most environment but not on
    ///         usage of namu framework.
    ///
    ///         why was it not proper to use as before?:
    ///             namu is based on class node and make user not need to know what really was.
    ///             all actions (including calling some func on namu env) can be replacable to sending
    ///             msg using "use()".
    ///             to say the least, what namu doing is loose-check.
    ///             so, strict type-checking of existing smart pointers doesn't matched to what namu
    ///             framework willing to do.
    ///
    ///     design:
    ///         binder components are mostly constructed to 3 classes and they form 2 layers vertically.
    ///         class binder:
    ///             represents binder on loose-checking layer.
    ///             user can try any type to bind or get from the binded. compiler won't complain
    ///             about. but because of loose-checking, if it's not proper request, binder will
    ///             warn you at runtime as result.
    ///             constness of binding instance was persisted. (for example, if user try to get
    ///             non-const instance from consted binder, s/he will get nulled reference.)
    ///             user needs to checks that returned value was nullref on using loose-checking API.
    ///
    ///         class tweak, class tstr:
    ///             these represent binder on strict-checking layer.
    ///             because it was declared to class template, user need to bind or get binded using
    ///             type T. of course these are based on class 'bind', user can use loose-check API
    ///             case by case.
